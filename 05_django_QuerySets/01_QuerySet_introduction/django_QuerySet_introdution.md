# Django QuerySet

A QuerySet is a collection of data from a database.

A QuerySet is built up as a list of objects.

QuerySets makes it easier to get the data you actually need,
by allowing you to filter and order the data at an early stage.

In this tutorial we will be querying data from the `Member` table.

**Member:**

| id  |  firstname  |  lastname  |   phone   |  joined_date  |
|:---:|:-----------:|:----------:|:---------:|:-------------:|
|  1  |  Emil       |  Refsnes   |  5551234  |  2022-01-05   |
|  2  |  Tobias     |  Refsnes   |  5557777  |  2022-04-01   |
|  3  |  Linus      |  Refsnes   |  5554321  |  2021-12-24   |
|  4  |  Lene       |  Refsnes   |  5551234  |  2021-05-01   |

##  Querying Data

In `members/views.py`, we have a view for testing called `testing`
where we will test different queries.

In the example below we use the `.all()` method to get all the
records and fields of the `Member` model:

```py
# members/views.py:

from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.template import loader
from .models import Member

def testing(request):
  mydata = Member.objects.all()
  template = loader.get_template('template.html')
  context = {
    'mymembers': mydata,
  }
  return HttpResponse(template.render(context, request))
```

The object is placed in a variable called `members`, and
is sent to the template via the context object as `members`,
and looks like this:

```py
<QuerySet [
  <Member: Member object (1)>,
  <Member: Member object (2)>,
  <Member: Member object (3)>,
  <Member: Member object (4)>,
  <Member: Member object (5)>
]>
```

As you can see, our `Member` model contains 5 records, and
are listed inside the `QuerySet` as 5 objects.

In the template you can use the `members` object to generate
content:

Template

```html
<!-- templates/template.html: -->

<table border='1'>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
  </tr>
  {% for x in mymembers %}
    <tr>
      <td>{{ x.id }}</td>
        <td>{{ x.firstname }}</td>
      <td>{{ x.lastname }}</td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
```
