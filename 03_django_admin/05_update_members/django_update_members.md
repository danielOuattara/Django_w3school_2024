# Django Admin - Update Members

## Â Update Members

Now we are able to create, update, and delete members
in our database, and we start by giving them all a date
for when they became members.

Click the first member, `Stalikken`, to open the record
for editing, and give him a `joined_date`:

While we are in here, let us give him a phone number as well:

Click "SAVE" and go back to the list of all members:

Repeat these steps and give all members a date and a phone number,
and end up with a list like this:
