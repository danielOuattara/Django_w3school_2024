# Django Models

**A Django model is a table in your database.**

##  First Django Models

Up until now in this tutorial, output has been static data
from Python or HTML templates.

Now we will see how Django allows us to work with data,
without having to change or upload files in the process.

In Django, data is created in objects, called Models,
and is actually tables in a database.

##  Create Table (Model)

To create a model, navigate to the `members/models.py` file.

Open it, and add a `Member table` by creating a `Member class`,
and describe the table fields in it:

```py
# my_tennis_club/members/models.py:

from django.db import models

class Member(models.Model):
  firstname = models.CharField(max_length=255)
  lastname = models.CharField(max_length=255)

```

- The first field, `first_name`, is a Text field, and will
  contain the first name of the members.

- The second field, `last_name`, is also a Text field, with
  the member's last name.

- Both `first_name` and `last_name` is set up to have a maximum
  of 255 characters.

```text
SQLite Database
----------------

When we created the Django project, we got an empty SQLite
database.

It was created in the `my_tennis_club` root folder, and has 
the filename `db.sqlite3`

By default, all Models created in the Django project will be created as tables in this database.
```

##  Migrate

We have described a Model in the `members/models.py` file, we
must run a command to actually create the table in the database.

Navigate to the `/11_django_models/my_tennis_club` folder and run this command:

```bash
python3 manage.py makemigrations members
```

Which will result in this output:

```bash
(env)~/11_django_models/my_tennis_club$ python3 manage.py makemigrations members
Migrations for 'members':
  members/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Member
(env)~/11_django_models/my_tennis_club$ 
```

Django creates a file describing the changes and stores the file
in the `/migrations/` folder:

```py
# Generated by Django 5.0.6 on 2024-05-30 16:42

from django.db import migrations, models


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    initial = True

    dependencies = [
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='Member',
            fields=[
                ('id', models.BigAutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),
                ('first_name', models.CharField(max_length=255)),
                ('last_name', models.CharField(max_length=255)),
            ],
        ),
    ]
```

### Note

Django inserts an `id` field for your tables,
which is an `auto increment number`: first record gets the value 1,
the second record 2 etc. This is the default behavior of Django,
you can override it by describing your own id field.

###  Caution

The `table` is not created yet, you will have to run one more
command, then Django will create and execute an SQL statement,
based on the content of the new file in the `/migrations/`
folder.

Run the migrate command:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

Which will result in this output:

```bash
...
python3 manage.py migrate

Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, members, sessions
Running migrations:
  Applying members.0001_initial... OK
  ...
```

**Now you have a Member table in you database !**

## View SQL

As a side-note: you can view the SQL statement that were executed
from the migration above.

All you have to do is to run this command, with the migration
number: `python3 manage.py sqlmigrate members 0001`

Which will result in this output:

```sql
BEGIN;
--
-- Create model Member
--
CREATE TABLE "members_member" (
  "id" integer NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, 
  "first_name" varchar(255) NOT NULL, 
  "last_name" varchar(255) NOT NULL
);

COMMIT;

```
