# Django Getting Started

To install Django, you must have Python installed, and a
package manager like `PIP`.

`PIP` is included in Python from version 3.4.

##  Django Requires Python

To check if your system has Python installed, run this
command in the command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed, you will get a result with the
version number, like this

```bash
Python 3.9.2
```

If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer,
then you can download it for free from the following website:
(<https://www.python.org/>)
